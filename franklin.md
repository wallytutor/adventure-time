# Basic Franklin extensions

You can include raw HTML by just surrounding a block with `~~~`.
Not much more to add.
This may be useful for local custom layouts like having a photo next to a text in a specific way.

~~~
<div class="row">
  <div class="container">
    <img class="left" src="/assets/rndimg.jpg">

    Marine iguanas are truly splendid creatures. They're found on the GÃ¡lapagos islands, have skin that basically acts as a solar panel, can swim and may have the ability to adapt their body size depending on whether there's food or not.

    Evolution is cool.

    <div style="clear: both"></div>      
  </div>
</div>
~~~

**Note 1**: again, entire such blocks can be made into latex-like commands via `\newcommand{\mynewblock}[1]{...}`.

**Note 2**: whatever is in a raw HTML block is *not* further processed (so you can't have LaTeX in there for instance). A partial way around this is to use `@@...` blocks which *will* be recursively parsed. The following code gives the same result as above with the small difference that there is LaTeX being processed in the inner div.

Marine iguanas are **truly splendid** creatures. They're not found in equations like $\exp(-i\pi)+1$. But they're still quite cool.
